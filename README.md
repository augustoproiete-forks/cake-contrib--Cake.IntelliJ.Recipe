## Install

```cs
#load nuget:?package=Cake.IntelliJ.Recipe
```

## Usage

```cs
#load nuget:?package=Cake.IntelliJ.Recipe

Environment.SetVariableNames();

BuildParameters.SetParameters(
  context: Context,
  buildSystem: BuildSystem,
  sourceDirectoryPath: "./src",
  title: "Best-Plugin-Ever",
  repositoryOwner: "nils-a");

BuildParameters.PrintParameters(Context);

ToolSettings.SetToolSettings(context: Context);

Build.Run();

```

Please be aware, that `Cake.IntelliJ.Recipe` wraps a `gradle` build
and uses tasks from `org.jetbrains.intellij` gradle plugin.
It is advised to create the plugin from https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template.

## Settings

### Publishing

To publish the plugin to the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/) a [token](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/author/me/tokens) is required.
The token must be supplied in an environment variable and then picked up in the `gradle` build.
Default for plugins created from https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template is to use the `PUBLISH_TOKEN` variable name.

Also, as with the "normal" gradle-based publishing, the first publish of the plugin must be made manually.

### Marketplace-ID

When publishing is automated, Twitter and Gitter messages can be created. To have them link to the plugin-page in the marketplace,
a setting of `marketplaceId` is needed. The `marketplaceId` can be fetched from the URL in the marketplace, e.g. for `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15698-test-rider`, the `marketplaceId` is `15698`.

All other settings for Twitter, Gitter and such follow [Cake.Recipe](https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.Recipe/docs/fundamentals/environment-variables#twitter).

### Grade-Verbosity

The verbosity of running gradle has it's own setting: `gradleVerbosity`. (Default is set to `GradleLogLevel.Default`)

Keep in mind, that while setting Cake verbosity to `diagnostic`, secrets will still be secret.
However, setting gradle verbosity to `GradleLogLevel.Debug` will print out all secrets in the logs.

## Changes to the template

When creating a new recipe for a plugin that was created from https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template 
the following changes have to be made:

### Readme

The standard template makes use of the `org.jetbrains.intellij` gradle-plugin to update the `<description>` of the `plugin.xml`
automatically from the content of the `Readme.md` which is perfectly fine.

If the `Readme.md` were to be moved (say one folder up - to fit in with the recipe structure) that would needed fixing.

The default code in `build.gradle.kts` is:
```java
// Extract the <!-- Plugin description --> section from README.md and provide for the plugin's manifest
pluginDescription(
    closure {
        File("./README.md").readText().lines().run {
            val start = "<!-- Plugin description -->"
            val end = "<!-- Plugin description end -->"

            if (!containsAll(listOf(start, end))) {
                throw GradleException("Plugin description section not found in README.md:\n$start ... $end")
            }
            subList(indexOf(start) + 1, indexOf(end))
        }.joinToString("\n").run { markdownToHTML(this) }
    }
)
```

This should point to the new location of the `Readme.md`, e.g.:
```java
// ...
  File("../README.md").readText().lines().run {
// ...
```

*Alternatively, the whole code-block could be removed from `build.gradle.kts` and a `<description>` manually added to the `plugin.xml`. 
Be aware, that the description is `html` with all entities encoded. (Something like `<description>&lt;h3&gt;This is the plugin!&lt;/h3&gt;</description>`).*

### Changelog

The standard template makes use of the `org.jetbrains.changelog` gradle-plugin to keep the `Changelog.md` updated with current version numbers and to copy the latest changes into the `<change-notes>` section of the `plugin.xml` on build.

Currently `Cake.IntellJ.Recipe` does not bridge the gap between release notes in GitHub releases (as preferred and automatically created by `Cake.Recipe`) and having the latest changes shown in the plugin (See [Issue 12](https://github.com/nils-a/Cake.IntelliJ.Recipe/issues/12)).

The suggestion is to place a link to the GitHub releases page inside the `change-notes` of `plugin.xml`.

For that, here are two parts inside `build.gradle.kts` which should be removed:

in `patchPluginXml`:
```java
// Get the latest available change notes from the changelog file
changeNotes(
    closure {
        changelog.getLatest().toHTML()
    }
)
```

and in `publishPlugin`:
```java
dependsOn("patchChangelog")
```

And the `change-notes` in `plugin.xml` have to be added manually. Something like 

```xml
<change-notes>
  &lt;a href="https://github.com/nils-a/test-rider/releases"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;See GitHub Releases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</change-notes>
``` 

is suggested.
